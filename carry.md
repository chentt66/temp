The "Cheapness" Leaderboard (Relative Value)

Concept: The dashboard likely ranks the 5 currencies (JPY, BRL, ISL, MXN, SGD) by their "Basis" (excess return).

Why it exists: It tells the Portfolio Manager: "Today, Brazil is paying 2% over USD, but Japan is only paying 0.2%."

Application: It acts as a capital allocation scanner. You don't trade it every minute; you check it once a week to decide where to deploy the next "rung" of the ladder.

The Logic: The "Excess Return" in your strategy is essentially the "price of USD shortage." The Explanation: "We use this as a dashboard for market health. When the 'Excess Return' on the dashboard spikes, it doesn't just mean the trade is profitable—it signals that the FX Swap market is breaking down (banks are refusing to lend USD).

$\Delta V_{bill} + \Delta V_{fwd} - I_{cost}$
It exists to compare interest rates. The dashboard simply calculates: 'If we move USD into JPY today and hedge it, do we beat the US Treasury rate?' It ranks the 5 currencies (JPY vs. MXN vs. BRL) to show the desk where the highest risk-free yield is available right now.
need to know where to source liquidity. The Explanation: "Even if we don't trade the full strategy, the ladder logic serves as a 'menu' for execution. If a trader needs to park $50M for 3 months, they look at the dashboard.

Since this is a systematic tool (dashboard) rather than a high-frequency trading bot, here are the three deep economic reasons for its existence that you should present in an interview.A. The Creation of "Synthetic Assets" (Theory Application)The Logic: Standard finance theory assumes a single "Risk-Free Rate." This project proves that false. By combining a Foreign Risk-Free Asset (T-Bill) with a Derivatives Overlay (FX Forward), you create a third, "Synthetic" asset.The Application: This tool exists to discover Capital Structure Arbitrage. It answers: "Is it mathematically superior to hold cash in a synthetic format (Hedged JPY) rather than a native format (US T-Bill)?" It turns the treasury function from a passive storage role into an active profit center.B. The "Basis" as a Scarcity Signal (Impact)The Logic: The "Excess Return" generated by this strategy is not random; it is the market price of Dollar Shortage. When the strategy yields 50bps over OIS, it means the global banking system is structurally short of USD and paying a premium for it.The Application: The dashboard acts as a Systemic Risk Gauge. A widening basis (higher strategy return) signals that global bank balance sheets are constrained (Basel III leverage ratios are binding). It alerts the desk that liquidity conditions are tightening before it shows up in equity volatility.C. Immunization via the Ladder (Construction)The Logic: Why a 13-week ladder? If you invest all capital in one 3-month bill, you face Reinvestment Risk (rolling over at a bad rate) and Liquidity Risk (locked up for 90 days).The Application: The ladder structure smooths the yield curve. By having $1/13^{th}$ of the portfolio mature every week, you average out the volatility of interest rates and FX forward points. It transforms a volatile "spot" investment into a stable "yield harvesting" machine. This construction is crucial for large-scale institutional cash management where consistency beats volatility.


To transform this from a **passive "Carry" benchmark** (just harvesting the spread) into an **active "Arbitrage" strategy** (predicting and optimizing returns), you need to introduce **choice** and **constraints**.

Currently, your logic is mechanistic: *"Bond issued  Buy  Hedge."*
An active arbitrage strategy asks: *"Is this specific bond/hedge mispriced enough to justify the risk and cost right now?"*

Here are three specific research extensions you can perform (using your existing data) to add an "Alpha" layer to your project. Adding any of these to your resume moves you from "Monitoring" to "Quantitative Research."

### 1. Term Structure Arbitrage ("Curve" Optimization)

Currently, you are locked into a **3-Month** tenor. But the "Basis" (the profit) is not flat across time. Sometimes the 1-month basis is huge (annualized), while the 3-month is tight.

* **The Research:** Compare the annualized hedged yield of **1M vs. 3M vs. 6M** tenors for the same currency.
* **The Strategy:** Instead of blindly rolling into the 3M bill, the algorithm dynamically selects the **"Steepest" point on the Basis Curve**.
* *Example:* If 1M annualized basis is 50bps and 3M is 20bps, invest in the 1M bill three times (rolling monthly) instead of one 3M bill.


* **Resume Bullet:** *"Conducted term-structure analysis on the Cross-Currency Basis curve, identifying optimal hedging tenors (1M vs. 3M) to maximize annualized roll-down yield."*

### 2. Statistical Entry/Exit Signals (Mean Reversion)

Currently, you roll every week regardless of the price. But the Basis is mean-reverting (it widens during stress and normalizes later).

* **The Research:** Model the Basis spread using an **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)** process or calculate a simple **Z-Score** (rolling 3-month mean/std dev).
* **The Strategy:** Introduce a "Gatekeeper" logic.
* **Entry Rule:** Only initiate a new ladder position if the Z-Score is  (Spread is historically wide/cheap).
* **Exit Rule:** If the Z-Score drops below  (Spread is tight), hold USD cash instead of forcing the trade.


* **Resume Bullet:** *"modeled the Cross-Currency Basis as a mean-reverting time series, developing Z-score signal thresholds to filter out low-conviction trades and improve Sharpe Ratio by 15%."*

### 3. Transaction Cost Analysis (The "Net" Reality)

True arbitrage disappears when you account for the Bid-Ask spread. A theoretical 10bps profit might actually be a -5bps loss if liquidity is poor.

* **The Research:** Overlay **Bid-Ask spread data** on your FX Forwards and T-Bills.
* **The Strategy:** Calculate the **"Break-Even Basis."** Determine the minimum spread required to overcome transaction costs.
* **Resume Bullet:** *"Integrated Bid-Ask spread dynamics into the backtest engine to calculate 'Net Realizable Basis', filtering out ~20% of trades where transaction friction eroded the theoretical arbitrage profit."*

### How to frame this transition

You are essentially moving the project from **Beta** (market exposure) to **Alpha** (timing and selection).

| Feature | Current "Benchmark" Approach | Proposed "Active Arb" Approach |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Selection** | Always buy JPY 3M T-Bill. | Buy whichever tenor (1M/3M) yields most. |
| **Timing** | Roll every Tuesday. | Roll only when Spread > Transaction Cost. |
| **Allocation** | Equal weight (1/13th). | Overweight currencies with widest basis. |
